This is the local park. #speaker:Mom
I often come here with my friends, but since some older kids/guys started coming here there have been some arguments between some scrappers. 
If you were ever in the middle of a fight you shouldn't get involved, they might hurt you.
Finally, this is my home. Beyond these buildings there are just companies and mountains. That's it. If you need something else you can come here to talk to me or to my father, the mayor.
I have to go now, it was nice to meet you. You have to walk the reverse way if you want to come back to your new house. See you soon!
